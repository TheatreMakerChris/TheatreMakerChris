- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheatreMakerChris
- 👀 I’m interested in ... we'll, everything, to be honest. This trait likely led me to my calling as a Teacher (Professor of Theatre Arts, Technical Theatre and Design, to be precise).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to program my Arduino projects. Hmm, that seems like a redundant prompt, yes?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any art-, performance-, storytelling-, music-, toy-, or game-related Arduino project. Seriously!
- 📫 How to reach me ... On Discord @ EitriIvaldison#9839
